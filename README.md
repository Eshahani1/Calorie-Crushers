The project aims to solve the problems of inaccurate calorie tracking and overwhelming user interfaces commonly found in fitness apps like MyFitnessPal and Lose It! These issues make it difficult for users to consistently track their calorie intake and meet their dietary or fitness goals. The proposed solution focuses on providing a simplified, user-friendly app with a clean interface, a highly accurate and verified food database, and barcode scanning to streamline food logging. The app also includes visual progress

The expected user experience revolves around simplicity, ease of use, and accuracy.

Key Design Elements: User Onboarding: During signup, users input basic information such as age, weight, goals, and gender. This helps personalize their experience and tailor recommendations.

Tracking Diet: The app provides a simple interface to log daily meals. Users can manually input food or use the barcode scanner for quick, accurate tracking of calories and macros, pulling data from a verified database.

Fitness Plan Integration: The app offers fitness plan tracking where users can log workouts and track progress in alignment with their dietary goals.

Minimalist UI: The interface is designed to be clean and intuitive, reducing clutter and focusing on essential elements like progress visuals, meal logging, and daily goals.

These design choices ensure users can easily track both their fitness and dietary progress without feeling overwhelmed by unnecessary complexity.





# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
